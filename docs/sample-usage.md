# Sample usage

There are no external dependencies or anything to install first.

Just clone the repo with `git`, or download it as a zip from [latest release](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/os-genesis/tags).

Then run commands in the project.

You will need `make` to run the commands here, but this is standard on Linux.


## Install packages

Install packages managed with and without APT.

```sh
$ make install
```


## Update packages
