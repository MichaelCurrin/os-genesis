The point of this project is to manage my infrastructure using code. I can list and change the packages installed on my Linux machines using commands here, including install Python and Node with APT.

This means I can setup a new machine easily, I can sync multiple Linux machines and I have my history in version control.

I hope others can benefit from this project by picking out pieces they need to run manually, or they can adapt the commands for their own automated scripts.
