A shell-based tool to automate management system packages on a Linux machine - the shell scripts in this repo act as a central configuration of packages to install and update.

Bootstrap a fresh Linux installation to make it ready for development and then maintain the packages and package configuration

This project aims to make this fast, easily, reproducible and visible in version control (with history).

This is for my own use, but others can use this project, a fork of it or just use this as reference on how to install/update packages (with and without APT).
