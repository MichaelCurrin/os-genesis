Orchestrate package management on a Linux dev machine with this shell-based tool. It handles installing, upgrading and listing packages managed both with and without APT. Including Dropbox, Firebox, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, Deno and Node.

If you're just here to see what APT packages I install using Bash scripts, see [install.sh](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/os-genesis/blob/master/genesis/apt/install.sh).
